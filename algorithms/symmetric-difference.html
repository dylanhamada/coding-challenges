    <title>Odds and Ends: Symmetric Difference</title>

        <h2 class="mb-4">Problem</h2>
        <p>The mathematical term symmetric difference (△ or ⊕) of two sets is the set of elements which are in
            either of the two sets but not in both.</p>
        <p>Create a function that takes two or more arrays and returns an array of their symmetric difference. The
            returned array must contain only unique values (no duplicates).</p>
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/algorithms/find-the-symmetric-difference"
            target="_blank">

        </a>
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-5 language-javascript">
        <h2 class="mb-4">Solution</h2>
        <p>I use a recursive function to solve this problem. The base case is a function argument that consists of only
            one array, in which case the function can no longer call itself. I also create a new array,
            <code>newArr</code>, to store the symmetric difference.</p>
        <p>If the base case isn't met, the first two arrays passed as an argument are passed into a helper function
            <code>checkDuplicate</code>, which iterates through the first array and checks if the second array includes
            the current element of the first array.</p>
        <p>If not, and if <code>newArr</code> doesn't include the current element, it's pushed into <code>newArr</code>.
        </p>
        <p><code>checkDuplicate</code> is run for both the first and second arrays, and then the entire function is
            called recursively, each time omitting the first two arrays that were originally passed in as arguments.
            Eventually, only one element is passed in as an argument, and the recursion ends.</p>
