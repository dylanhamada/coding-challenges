# Coding Challenges

A repo to store JavaScript coding challenges.

## Introduction

To keep my JavaScript knowledge intact and learn new techniques, I've decided to maintain a repo of JS coding challenges.

These will primarily cover algorithms and data structures.

## Project Status

This project is ongoing and is updated regularly.

## Installation and Instructions

All code is written in JavaScript and will run in the console.

**To install:**

Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.

**To run:**

Open a terminal and navigate to a folder that contains an exercise JS file. 

In the terminal, type `node exercise.js`, where "exercise.js" is the file name of the exercise.

The console will display the problem and solution to the exercise. 

Detailed information about the solution can be found within the JS file itself.
